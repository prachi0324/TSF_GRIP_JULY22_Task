# TSF_GRIP_JULY22_Task-1
This repository contains the task 1 done by me during the summer internship Under The Spark Foundation.
# Linear Regression Model
Task: To Explore Supervised Machine Learning In this regression task, we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hours in a day?
